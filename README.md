# Gene expression of clinical UPEC during mouse UTI

## Introduction

Comparison of UPEC gene expression during human UTI to that during mouse UTI

## Results
## Methods
### Find orthologs

- Run find_orthologs.py script with default params

    ``` python find_orthologs.py -l data/genome_list.txt -e -o /Users/annasintsova/git_repos/upec_mouse_model/private_results/```



### Identifying pangenome of clinical UPEC strains
### RNAseq data processing

 - Same pipeline as before
